                    <u><h2>About Me</h2></u>
                    <p>Hey there, thanks for stopping by my digital portfolio! My name's Parth Shah, I am a high school student, who lives in a suburban area of Los Angeles. I'm a kid who loves participating in extracurriculars and volunteering. Some of the extracurriculars I take part in are Robotics, the IT student lead team at my school, and cultural clubs. Some volunteering activities I take part in include First's Lego League mentorship of children interested in STEM, Leora Trust's organization which offers english literacy to undeserved youth in india, and an organization which raises funds for free surgeries. Now that you've learned a little bit about me why not take a look at the rest of my portfolio!  </p>
